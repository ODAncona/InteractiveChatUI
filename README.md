# InteractiveChatUI

Build Chat UI component for structured Exa search.

The purpose of the prototype is to understand how to insert dynamic component in a Chat UI.

Technologies used in this prototype:

- [Vercel AI SDK Core](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-core/overview)
- [Vercel AI SDK UI](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-ui/overview)
- [Exa Search API](https://docs.exa.ai/sdks/python-sdk-specification#getting-started)
- Exa MCP Server

## Principle

Let X an agent that takes natural language queries and returns structured search result schemas and calls the Exa Search API to get the data with the schema and generate a UI based on the schema.

- Vercel AI SDK Core => create a chat agent that can process natural language queries and return structured search result schemas.
- Vercel UI SDK => create a chat UI that allows users to interact with the Exa Search API in a conversational manner.
- Exa Search API => provide real-time web search capabilities based on the schema defined by the agent.

### Exa MCP

Exa MCP Server enables AI assistants like Claude to perform real-time web searches through the Exa Search API, allowing them to access up-to-date information from the internet in a safe and controlled way.

- Real-time web searches with optimized results
- Structured search responses (titles, URLs, content snippets)
- Support for specialized search types (web, academic, social media, etc.)
